# Rubbish

A simple home inventory project to track my rubbish at home.

## Refactor note

The majority of this codebase is going to be scrapped soon to be replaced by
a fixity focused (ie, not abstracted) web server providing a web based gui to
interact with it.

Until the refactor takes place, this codebase is mainly for experimenting
with the data structure, finding new features for fixity, etc.
